# whoisfree
A complete timetable management system for Faculties, Students or any VIT club/chapter.
This Project mainly focuses on making it easier for the Faculty, Students and clubs or Chapters to keep track of the timetable of all the students in the class. The project takes the user details such as name, registration number, Role in Chapter, Contact number and All the slots of the user that are occupied. Then it allows the functionality of finding who is free during a particular slot or during given set of slots.

This website will allow any club/chapter or organization, to effectively manage and view all the members' timetable and free slots. Admin can register all the users, with their timetable data. With the help of an interactive GUI, the admin can select the slots which the member is having. The admin can also upload a screenshot of the timetable image, for further reference. After adding all the members, any user can search the students who all are free in a given time. For example, if we select Tuesday 2pm to 3pm, it will show a list of all users who are free in that slot. The name, mobile no, email id, etc. of the members can be stored. Admin can also post notices for all the members to view.
